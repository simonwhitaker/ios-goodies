# Goo Software iOS Goodies

A collection of widgets and stuff for iOS, for you to use as you see fit.

## Licensing and attribution

License details are in UNLICENSE. Basically, licensing is as liberal as
we can make it. Help yourself. :)

We know it's not always possible or desirable to attribute third-party 
code in your app, but if you can add an attribution it'll help other 
developers to find these goodies, and it'll give us a warm tingly feeling 
inside. We'd suggest:

*Uses GOODY_NAME by Goo Software Ltd: http://github.com/simonwhitaker/ios-goodies*

Please also let us know that you're using the goodies so that we can 
point other prospective users to your app as an in-the-wild demo.
